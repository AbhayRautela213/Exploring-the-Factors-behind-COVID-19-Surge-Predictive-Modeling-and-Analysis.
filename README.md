# Exploring-the-Factors-behind-COVID-19-Surge-Predictive-Modeling-and-Analysis.

In this project, we leverage predictive modelling techniques to understand the relationships between various parameters, the rise in the number of cases, and the spreading patterns of COVID-19. We collect a dataset from various government sources, including information on temperature,
humidity, air quality index, demographic characteristics, medical history, surgical history, and lifestyle habits. Among all these factors temperature has the most significant imapact over COVID 19 transmission.

## About the Project

This research paper aims to address this issue by exploring the data collected from official sources in India, which includes variables such as temperature, humidity, air quality index, demographic characteristics, medical history, and lifestyle choices. We aim to use predictive modelling approaches to explore the connection between numerous parameters and the number of COVID-19 cases in the Delhi-NCR region. The dataset's characteristics were identified through exploratory data analysis, and subsequent modelling processes included feature selection, model training, and evaluation to ensure accurate predictions. A Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LightGBM) model is employed for the analysis. In addition, the influence of demographic characteristics, medical and surgical history, smoking and alcohol habits, and an athletic lifestyle on COVID-19 patients is also investigated. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the various dynamics of COVID-19 transmission and may be used to design specific treatments and public health initiatives for effective control and prevention.

The dataset is prepared manually based on the publication available on the official government website. The data was collected from recognized international organizations like the World Health Organisation (WHO) and official sources within the Indian government, including statistics and health departments. The collected data included parameters such as temperature, humidity, air quality index, senior citizen population, gender diversity, labor/hazardous work percentage, prior medical and surgical history, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases, smoking and alcohol habits, and the athletic individual's percentage. This dataset covers a significant period of the COVID-19 pandemic, ranging from January 2020 to December 2022.

The prediction modeling and analysis performed in this study provide useful insights into the factors adding to the surge in COVID-19 cases in the Delhi-NCR region. The results show important connections and trends that help in understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 spread and guide tailored medicines, public health measures, and resource allocation techniques. It is found that temperature has a substantial effect on COVID- 19 cases. The LightGBM model is employed to predict the number of cases and evaluate the predictive power of the dataset. In this paper, the model’s performance is measured in the terms of mean absolute error(MAE), mean squared error(MSE), and R-Squared(R2). The model is applied to the testing dataset after being trained on the training dataset, and it performs excellently with an accuracy of 95.4%.

## Goals

• Understand the relationships between various parameters and the number of COVID-19 cases.
• Analyze the spreading patterns of COVID-19 and identify key factors driving the surge in cases.
• To develop accurate predictive models for forecasting COVID-19 cases in the region.
• Support public health officials, policymakers, and medical experts in creating practical plans to limit the spread of the virus and mitigate its impact on the population.
• To contribute to the existing knowledge and understanding of the complex dynamics underlying the COVID-19 pandemic.
